**Self-Sovereign, Blockchain and Decentralized Identity Resources**


>A good self‐sovereign identity system will allow individuals to directly influence how companies, governments, and others correlate our interactions across different services and locations by default. It won’t fix all identity problems nor preclude alternative identity approaches, but it will put the individual in control of most uses of identity and give organizations a simpler, easier, more ethical way to use identity to improve how they provide services and products. When successful, it will not only enable individuals to exercise greater control over how companies and governments keep track of us, it will also illuminate those situations where self‐sovereign identity is restricted, facilitating a conversation about when and where such limits are appropriate.

## What is Decentralized ID?

The essence of Decentralized-ID is to create systems for identification that are not owned by any one particular organization, and global collaboration in support of interoperability among emerging technologies for identity. 

It's impossible to have a conversation about decentralized-id without discussing blockchain and self sovereign identity: 
  * Blockchain fueled longstanding efforts to create a privacy preserving internet-wide identity protocol, and inspired development of decentralized networks for online identification. 
  * Self Sovereign Identity principles (with some help from the GDPR) have helped to shape the narrative around putting the identity owner in control over their personal information.
  * The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have also helped to fueled efforts for a global and widely accessible identity solution.

## DID Adoption

* did:btcr:      - [BTCR DID Method](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/) 
  * The Bitcoin Reference DID method (did:btcr) supports DIDs on the public Bitcoin blockchain. The Bitcoin Reference method has minimal design goals: a DID trust anchor based on the Bitcoin blockchain, updates publicly visible and auditable via Bitcoin transactions, and optionally, additional DID Document information referenced in the transaction OP_RETURN data field. No other Personal Identifiable Information (PII) would be placed on the immutable blockchain.

  - Blockstack is a network for decentralized applications where users own their identities and data. Blockstack utilizes a public blockchain to implement a decentralized naming layer, which binds a user's human-readable username to their current public key and a pointer to their data storage buckets.
