# decentralized-id.com — Readme

You can start by checking out [index.md](/index.md) or [decentralized-id.com](https://decentralized-id.com).

This is meant to be a community space. I moved it here so that it could easily have its own web-page via github pages, and to make it a little less "mine" and a little more "ours".

If you have a project in the decentralized-id ecosystem, feel free to create a page to be included on this site.
