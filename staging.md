## Structured Data Standards [**^**](#contents) 

* [Blockcerts](https://www.blockcerts.org), developed by[Learning Machine](https://www.learningmachine.com/), is an open standard for issuing and verifying blockchain-based official records; The project offers  open-source libraries, tools, and mobile apps. MIT has [issued](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/10/19/mit-introduces-digital-diplomas) digital certificates based on this standard.

  * [A Decentralized Approach to Blockcerts Credential Revocation](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2017/blob/master/final-documents/blockcerts-revocation.md)
* [Schema](https://schema.org) — a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet. Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences."
   * [ÆTERNITY](http://aeternity.com/) [[**G**](https://github.com/aeternity/protocol)]: using Schema's standards: "offers an identity architecture where every account has a unique ID number, and unique names can be registered and linked to arbitrary data such as addresses on the blockchain. Schema's are used for representing data about persons and organizations."

No other Personal Identifiable Information (PII) would be placed on the immutable blockchain.

Our naming protocol differs from its predecessors in that it has no concept of namespacing or subdomains at the consensus layer. Its purpose is not to replace DNS, but to replace the root zone file and the root servers.
